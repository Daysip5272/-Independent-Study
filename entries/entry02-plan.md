# Entry 2: Trying SASS
## How to install SASS
In order to install SASS into your workspace terminal check that you are in the right 
workspace terminal and then type in `gem install sass`. 
An then type `sass -v` and it should return `Sass 3.4.23 (Selective Steve)`, if
it does not return that then SASS is not installed in your workspace terminal.
In case `gem install sass` does not work at all, then try `sudo gem install sass`.

Next, you sould open a filed by typing in the terminal `touch input.scss` where a file would be created

After, add some sass code in `input.scss`, then in the terminal type `sass input.scss output.css`.

Once you did that, you should see `output.css` in your workspace with all of your changes from your SASS file.

Note: SCSS is another name for a SASS file

## Takeaways
1. DONT GIVE UP AND PLAY AROUND WITH IT .
2. 














Once you are done with all of your necessary changes in your SASS file, you can save
your changes into a CSS file by running sass input.scss output.css inside of your terminal. 
Once you did that, you should see output.css in your workspace with all of your changes from your SASS file.

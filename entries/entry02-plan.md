# Entry 2: Trying SASS
## How to install SASS
In order to install SASS into your workspace terminal check that you are in the right 
workspace and then in the terminal type `gem install sass`. 
An then type `sass -v`, it should return `Sass 3.4.23 (Selective Steve)`, if
it does not return that then SASS is not installed in your workspace terminal.
In case `gem install sass` does not work at all, then try `sudo gem install sass`.

Next, you sould open a filed by typing in the terminal `touch input.scss` where a file would be created

After, add some sass code in `input.scss`, then in the terminal type `sass input.scss output.css`.

Once you did that, you should see a file name `output.css` where all of your changes from your SASS file would be.

Note: SCSS is another name for a SASS file

# Birth Month Flowers
The final project for SEP class where everyone would enjoy reading through it since it can relate 
to each student. The project is still in progress since it need a lot of much details then just the info.
My knowlegde on SASS has become really useful for this project since its going be really colorful
and going have different parts on the scss spread around the code meaning the same code is going be 
use in different places. With the variables method and functions of Sass it would be really used full 
just to place the colors in different line or different boxes of the chart. 

With the `<table>` and the  `<td>` I was able to make the chart where the information would be 
place for the used to have a much easier way to read and find his or her month flower. The `<table>` would 
be place on the `index.html` of the project SASS so that in the `input.scss` it could be style with variables 
to make it much colorful and more organize. 

# Next Steps 
- Add more colors with variables to make chart colorful and attractive to gain more viewer.
- add images with a little of information from that flower.
- add a comment box where people would would write advices.

# Takeaways 
Research a lot. Google is your bestfriend. I did not know how to make a chart so that iu could put the info in it,
so I google charts for Html w3school and and the `<table>` came out making my life much more easier cuz google
had help me find what i need it. Therefore google and google stuff you don't know. Like for example another 
thing that happen to me is that I want to use different fonts but cloud 9 only alLows to use some of them meaning
that I need to find an api or something else, making it hard for to complete my goal but with google i'm still researching.

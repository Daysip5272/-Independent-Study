# @Mixin & @include
Mixins can take multiple arguments.
Sass allows it to explicitly define each argument in your @include statement.
When values are explicitly specified you can send them out of order.

If a mixin definition has a combination of arguments with and without
a default value, you should define the ones with no default value first.

Here's an example of my input.scss below:
```scss
@mixin transform-style($style){
   transform-style: $style;
  -moz-transform-style: $style;
  -o-transform-style: $style;
  -ms-transform-style: $style;
  -webkit-transform-style: $style;
}
.notecard {
  @include transform-style(preserve-3d);
  width: 300px;
  height: 180px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  display: inline-block;}
```
Now, I'll show you the CSS code below:
```css 
.notecard {
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  -moz-transform-style: preserve-3d;
  -o-transform-style: preserve-3d;
  -ms-transform-style: preserve-3d;
  -webkit-transform-style: preserve-3d;
  width: 300px;
  height: 180px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  display: inline-block;}
```
### Sass allows you to pass in multiple arguments in a list or a map format
When you include a mixin, then it can be pass in these arguments in a map with the following `...` notation.
```scss
$stripe-properties: to bottom, 15%, blue, white;

.definition {
    @include stripes($stripe-properties...);
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;}
```
Now, I'll show you my CSS code below:
```css
.definition {
  background: repeating-linear-gradient(to bottom, white, white 14%, blue 1%, white 15%);
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```
Also in Sass there is something called string interpolation which is the process of placing a
variable string in the middle of two other strings.
- it can be use when you want to make use of variables in selectors or file names

# Functions and operations
With Sass functions you can:

- Operate on color values
- Iterate on lists and maps
- Apply styles based on conditions
- Assign values that result from math 

## Takeaways 
1. Make sure you have a clear understanding of your own topic and how it can be used to create a project.
2. Learning to code takes time, but itâ€™s worth it. Make sure to read everything because everything helps to learn and to better things with the stuff you had learn.
3. Break a part the code to learn what every like of does. 
4. Never give up and try it out, if you can`t solve it google it because he is your frined that will always help you out.

# Entry 1: Intro / Plan
I had spent the past week going through sites searching for an specific topic to start learning about
throught this 9 weeks. Since I like CSS I desided to do an independente study about SASS. Which is another 
similar to CSS. For that reason I started to begging working on codecademy where it just giving me 
review on how SASS works. Working on codecademy had help me reviewed and
expanded on my knowledge on stuff that I had forgotten about HTML/CSS. Through this process I had learn
and review alot of stuff but as I go im still learning on how SASS works and for me it had made me get really interested in it.
As where im righ now, im still reviewing and learning more about SASS. 

## What is Sass?
SASS is a css preprocessor which is a scripting language that extends CSS by allowing developers
to write code in one language and then compile it into CSS. Sass stand for Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets which  is an extension of CSS. 
Sass allows you to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more. 
It can also help you to keep things organized and also itallows you to create stylesheets faster.

# Adding To Final Project
### W3schools on the HELP

Review CSS Tutorial makes you have an open mind to what stuff you want to make with Sass. 
Like in my case, I decided to make a website since I could add what I had learned from Sass. The reviewing of
css was really helpful since it made me think on what my website could have or if it's going be multiple pages. 

I had review though many css examples and it had help me a lot to be able to make and
templet in my mind to what I want my website to have and what it could do. It not easy 
thinking about how exactly to do a website and how to put all my knowledge of sass in it since 
it something new for me and i hadn't used it before. It's going be challengeable but not impossible.

The syntax that sass has its gonna be make my code easy but aLso challengeable since most the code I
hadn't use it in css before because there are mixin, including, functions, and operation and also because mainly
the syntax of sass has to do with variables, something that I had not used before to make css code. 

During this week of work I hadn't learn new stuff but what I did was reviewing all css examples 
that was really helpfull for me to be able to write scss code to turn it into a more organized css
code that would be easier to read.

## CSS Tutorial
The main css code was easy to review but the most advanced css, took me a while to understand it since it had multiple differents parts in the same code
like the css3 which are the Animations, transitions, and stuff like that. It was challenging because in the same line it has
multiple number that are being use for different purposes. That what made it hard for me to understand. 

## Next week Goals
* Start add more sass code to get css code for my website.
* To start finding some information on what my website is going contain, which is flower and there month of when they bloom or grow.

## Takeaways
Coding is not EASY. But by thinking through and analyzing everything makes it way easy to know what you are writing down. That what I had learn through this couple of weeks.
Never give up and take your time because code it's not easy to understand fully. The review of css3 made it hard for but i never give up. But I did instead was play and play around with the code and see what changes, so that i could know what exactly that part of code does.
